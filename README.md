The Weather API project is a web application that allows users to access current weather data for any location around the world. The project uses a third-party weather API to retrieve and display the weather information, which is then presented to the user in a user-friendly format. 

The application is built using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project uses JavaScript to make API calls to the weather API, retrieve the data, and then display it in the front-end of the application.
